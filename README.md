# Bad Apple Discord Bot

A simple Discord bot that plays the Bad Apple animation.

## Setup

The Bad Apple Discord bot runs using discord.py. To add your bot's token, create an environment variable (e.g., a .env file) with the key as "TOKEN" and the value as your bot's token. The first time you use the bot, it may load slowly as it caches all of the GIFs. Subsequent usage should be faster.

## Commands

- `!help` - Display a list of available commands.
- `!ping` - Check the bot's latency.
- `!bad apple` - Plays the Bad Apple animation.
- `!rickroll` - Get rickrolled.
